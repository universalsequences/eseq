## Instrument testing

Use `instrument_probe` when changing DGenLisp instruments, wavetable/tensor loading, or host-side instrument initialization. It exercises the same host compile/load/init path as the app and gives quick signal checks without launching the UI.

Example:

```sh
cargo run --bin instrument_probe -- emulations/monomachine-dpro-wave-v2 \
  --frames 4096 \
  --min-peak 0.01 \
  --min-rms 0.001
```

For saved instrument names, the probe resolves local assets from the saved instrument directory. For direct file paths, it resolves assets from the source file's parent directory. Use `--param name=value` for parameter overrides and `--json` for machine-readable output.
